"Fact": "Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the second planet from the sun. After the Moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in the night sky. Althought it is called Earth's sister planet, the two are very different-- Venus has the densest atmosphere of the four inner planets. The atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times that of Earth's. It is also the hottest planet in the Solar System. Venus takes 224.65 days to complete each orbit. A day on Venus is longer than a year(longest day in the entire Solar System). Venus also rotates backwards compared to other planets."}
